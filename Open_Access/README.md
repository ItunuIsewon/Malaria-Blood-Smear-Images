# Open Access Datasets

This is a collection of openly accessible datasets, as reported by the researchers. This collection contains both datasets with both thick and thin image datasets and those with thick and thin image datasets only.

## Key Learning Outcomes
After completing this practical, you should be able to:
  1. know how to adjust for ascertainment bias in case-control analysis
  2. Know how over-fitting aﬀects PRS results and how to handle it 
  3. understand distribution of PRS
  4. understand diﬀerent file formats involved in gene-set analysis
  5. understand diﬀerence between self-contained and competitive gene-set analyses
  6. Calculate pathway based PRS
