# Thick and Thin Blood Smear Images
These datasets contain both thick and thin blood smear images from one source.

Thick and thin blood smears are prepared for the diagnosis of malaria using microscopy. They are prepared from blood samples collected from the patient. The smears are best prepared from capillary blood obtained by a finger prick.

The thin smear is used to identify the malaria parasite species; the life cycle stages and parasitaemia quantification. It is less sensitive when the parasite density (parasitaemia) is low. It is easy to differentiate the difference between the red blood cells and other components because of better visibility (Rehman et al., 2018). 

The thick blood smear is thicker, and it is prepared by swirling the drop of blood, it allows more blood volume to be examined. It is used to detect the parasite, and it has a higher sensitivity than the thin blood smear. The red blood cells are ruptured, and only the white blood cells, platelets, and parasites are seen. It can also be used to estimate parasitaemia (Poostchi et al., 2018; Rosado et al., 2017).
