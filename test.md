# Malaria Blood Smear Images


Computer-aided diagnosis uses computers and computational tools to analyze and evaluate medical data for diagnosing diseases. Recent advances in research have demonstrated the use of computer-aided diagnosis methods for diagnosing diseases. This repository contains all available malaria blood smear image datasets. It is a one-stop shop for researchers and developers working on malaria detection and diagnosis. These datasets were obtained by carrying out a systematic review of papers published between 2013 and 2023 on automated malaria diagnosis.
