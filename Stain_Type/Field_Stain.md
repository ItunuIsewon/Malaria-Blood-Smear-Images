# Field Stain
These are blood smear datasets stained with the Field staining reagent.

Field stain is a rapid staining method for blood smears that can be used to diagnose malaria. The stain is easy to use, has a short staining time, and is not expensive.

Field stain is not as sensitive as Giemsa stain, but it is still effective for detecting malaria parasites. It is a good option for use in resource-limited settings where Giemsa stain is not available or where time is limited.
