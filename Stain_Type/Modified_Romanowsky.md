# Modified Romanowsky Stain
This dataset contains images stained with a modified Romanowsky stain, which is a variation of the Romanowsky stain used to stain blood smears for the diagnosis of malaria. 

It is a mixture of eosin and methylene blue. The eosin stains the cytoplasm of the malaria parasites red, and the methylene blue stains the nucleus of the malaria parasites blue. This makes it possible to see the malaria parasites under a microscope and to identify the different species of malaria parasites.

The modified Romanowsky stain is a reliable and effective method for staining thick blood smears for malaria diagnosis. It is a simple and inexpensive procedure.
