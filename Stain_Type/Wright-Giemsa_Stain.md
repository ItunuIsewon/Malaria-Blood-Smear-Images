# Wright-Giemsa Stained Blood Film Images

The Wright-Giemsa stain can be used as a staining reagent in diagnosing malaria. Wright and Giemsa stains are combined and aids in the identification and differentiation of Plasmodium species. 
The process involves preparing a blood smear, fixing it in methanol, staining, rinsing, and drying. Under the microscope, malaria parasites appear as blue to purple rings within red blood cells.
