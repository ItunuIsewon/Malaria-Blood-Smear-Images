# Leishman Stain 

Leishman stain is a Romanowsky stain used in microscopy to differentiate between and identify white blood cells and malaria parasites.

It is a mixture of eosin and methylene blue, and it stains the chromatin of cells blue and the cytoplasm red. This makes it possible to see the parasites under a microscope and to identify the different species of Plasmodium.

Leishman stain is a reliable and effective method for staining blood smears and identifying malaria parasites. The procedure is relatively simple and inexpensive, and it can be performed in resource-limited settings.
